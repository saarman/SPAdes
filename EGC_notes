Step 2. FASTQ 

1. cd /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/saarman-group1/uphlfiles

2. mkdir fastq 

3. fastqc ./subseq/*.fq -o fastqc

*chmod -R g+w fastqc *not working? saying either I don't have permission or the directory doesn't exist
*download html files and open in browser to see QC

***found subseq files for R2 in the uphlfiles folder mv to subseq do fastq for R2s.. not sure why there are duplicates. Worth removing?
rm MAD_21_B002f_R2_001_sub1.fq 
*also checked in the dashboard and removed files with 0 bites.. not sure why they were there hopefully ok!

ERROR - No such file or directory // Can't open

Still not getting the same results. 
Tried chmod -R g+w denovo_assembly on the whole directory first, then running the code but that has same error

Tried running above code again -

***Looked like it worked though - they all have sorted contigs fasta files!

cd /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/saarman-group1/uphlfiles
chmod -R g+w subseq
chmod: changing permissions of 'subseq': Operation not permitted

*Going back through trying to remember next steps - 
UT-M07101-240702 ready for analysis with contig files
UT-M70330-240718 has contig files but no seqkit performed 

*Which method should I try first? Should I use Seqtk again to filter?
*Start with filtering and see what hits we get sample by sample, then try other methods with samples that do not show up on BOLD/BLAST? 


10/30/24

Made new directory so I could use the same code for Colony samples (Colony-UT-10-30)

chmod -R g+w /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/saarman-group1/uphlfiles/UT-M70330-240718/Colony-UT-10-30

1. Fastqc was fast and worked well, put all fastqc for both folders into the Fastqcfiles directory in SPADES_scripts
2. SPAdes is taking forever! Probably should do in parallel next time...
 4573731 saarman-s   SPAdes u1055819  R    1:24:35      1 notch320
Stopped at 24 hour cut off. Moved files to spades_assembly_test and reran with 300 hour limit and put into denovo_assembly output
3. Filtering - asking chat... thinking of raising min coverage to ~5

Typical considerations for de novo SPAdes assemblies:
Filter	Your Value	Typical Use Cases	Comments
Min Length =	200 bp	200–500 bp	✅ Reasonable — 200 is a common threshold to remove short, likely spurious contigs.
Min Coverage = 2x	5–10x (often)	⚠️ Low — 2x may allow in low-confidence contigs with poor support.
Max Length	= 3000 bp	Rarely filtered	⚠️ Unusual — SPAdes often assembles useful contigs >3kb (including entire genes or plasmids).

🔧 Recommendations:
Min Length (LENGTH=200) ✅ Good default. Go higher (e.g. 500) if you want stricter quality or are not worried about losing small plasmids or fragments.
Min Coverage (COVERAGE=2) ⚠️ Too permissive — SPAdes can produce low-coverage artifacts.
💡 Consider raising to COVERAGE=5 or COVERAGE=10, depending on your dataset and sequencing depth.
If coverage is uneven (e.g., metagenomics), you can stick with 2–5 but be aware of noise.
Max Length (MAXLEN=3000) ❌ Usually not needed. Larger contigs are often more informative.
💡 Unless you're specifically targeting short sequences (like viral genomes), consider removing this filter or increasing it significantly (e.g., 50,000 or no max).
